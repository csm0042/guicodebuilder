guicodebuilder
==========

This package can be used to create a python file containing a class and associated methods that can be called to
generate a GUI for an application.  The layout and content of the GUI is determined by parameters entered into an
INI file which the code then interprets and uses to write a custom python file containing a class and methods specific
to that specific GUI layout and content.  The resulting file "gui.py" can then be imported and used in other python
applications and packages, simplifying the creation of the GUI that you would otherwise have to code along with the
rest of the application code.
